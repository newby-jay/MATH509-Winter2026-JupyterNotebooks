Presumably firefighters do not cause fires. Nevertheless, this is not a spurious correlation. Instead fires cause firefighters. Consider the same reversal of causal inference in the context of the divorce and marriage data. How might a high divorce rate cause a higher marriage rate? Can you think of a way to evaluate this relationship using multiple regression?"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"jcPrdxP1C4W7"},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"g-it0gNXC4W7"},"source":["# Q2\n","In the divorce data, States with high numbers of Mormons (members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, LDS) have much lower divorce rates than the regression models expected.

The urban fox (Vulpes vulpes) is a successful exploiter of human habitat. Since urban foxes move in packs and defend territories, data on habitat quality and population density is also included.

Compare the results of these models to the previous models you've fit, in the first two exercises. (a) Is `avgfood` or `area` a better predictor of body weight? If you had to choose one or the other to include in a model, which would it be? Support your assessment with any tables or plots you choose. (b) When both `avgfood` or `area` are in the same model, their effects are reduced (closer to zero) and their standard errors are larger than when they are included in separate models.
