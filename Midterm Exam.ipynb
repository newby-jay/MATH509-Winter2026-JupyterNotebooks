She works for a large regional park. They have been having problems with wolves attacking small pets in campgrounds and hiking trails. They are interested in exploring the option of relocating the wolves. In order to make a recomendation, they first need to know more about how the wolves wander near their den. They know the wolf den moves between two seasonal locations. They want to know how far, on average, wolves wander from their den for both the summer and winter. The parks staff has kept records over the past five years of any contact with wolves. Any time a wolf or their tracks are sighted, a position is recorded along with the date. The positions are in kilometers relative to center of the park, with positive `y` pointing north and positive `x` pointing east. You agree to help, and the ecologist sends you a CSV file with the wolf data.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","# A\n","Load the data from the file `wolves.csv` in the data folder into a Pandas dataframe. There are 3 colunns: `x`, `y`, and `date`. Look through the data and locate any rows that have been corrupted, improperly formated, or have incomplete data. Filter out any that you find, and create a new dataframe with the cleaned data.\n","\n","# B\n","Sort the observations between summertime and wintertime. Chose date ranges that divide the two seasons based on looking/plotting the data. Make sure all of the observations are used (none are left out).\n","\n","# C\n","Plot the positions $x$ vs $y$, for both winter and summer, as a scatter plot.

Your model should depend on the position of the summertime and wintertime wolf den.\n","\n","# F\n","Propose informative priors for any parameters in the model, create prior predictive plots, and describe the reasoning you used to justify your choices.\n","\n","# G\n","Use MCMC sampling (use 4 chains each with 1000 samples) to estimate the posterior. Plot the corresponding posterior probability density function for the mean squared distance of wolf sighting from the den position for both winter and summer and for both north/south and east/west distance (using a KDE). That means four total KDE plots.
